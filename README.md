# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

E-Commerce Back End manages the database containing the inventory of your onlinen business!  Simply enter ```npm start``` into the CLI at the directory of your choice to start the server and use the designated API Routes to create, read, update, and delete data.

You will be able to add and manipulate the Categories of your inventory, as well as the Products and any Tags (descriptions) associated with those products.  A simple app that will make all the updates you need through your front-end application.

Built with a Node.js server, the application uses Sequelize for the model elements and Express to route the requests.

You will need to build the database and seed any data using the database management system of your choice.  See the demo video in the next section for an example of how to build and seed the database.
